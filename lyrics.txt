Test Addessment Report


This was a triumph.
#CI'm making a note here: 
HUGE SUCCESS.
It's hard to overstate
my satisfaction.
#0Aperture Science
We do what we must
because we can.
For the good of all of us.
#1Except the ones who are dead.

#0But there's no sense crying
over every mistake.
You just keep on trying
till you run out of cake.
#2And the science gets done.
And you make a neat gun.
#0For the people who are
still alive.

Dear <<Subject Name Here>>,

I'm not even angry.
I'm being so sincere right now.
Even though you #3broke my heart.
And killed me.
#6And tore me to pieces.
And threw every piece into #4a fire.
As they burned it hurt because
#5I was so happy for you!
Now these points of data
make a beautiful line.
And we're out of beta.
We're releasing on time.
#6So I'm GLaD. I got burned.
#2Think of all the things we learned
#0for the people who are
still alive.

One last thing:


Go ahead and leave me.
I think I'd prefer to stay inside.
Maybe you'll find someone else
to help you.
Maybe #7Black Mesa...
THAT WAS A JOKE. FAT CHANCE.
Anyway, #8this cake is great.
It's so delicious and moist.
#9Look at me still talking
#1when there's science to do.
#0When I look out there,
it makes me GLaD I'm not you.
#2I've experiments to run.
#6There is research to be done.
#0On the people who are
still alive.
